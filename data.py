    "story": """
        I began my journey in tech in 2019, building small web applications and learning the fundamentals of programming.
        Since then, I've expanded my skillset to include backend development, database design, and machine learning.
        
        I love building applications that solve real-world problems and improve people's lives. My approach combines 
        technical knowledge with a focus on user experience and clean design.
        
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking, reading tech blogs, and contributing to open-source projects.
